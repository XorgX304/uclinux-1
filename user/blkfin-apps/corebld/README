corebld - A simple ELF loader for BF561 core B

corebld can be used to load binary built with bfin-elf-gcc. If the default link script cannot match your requirement,
you can customize the link script.
For details, please refer to: http://docs.blackfin.uclinux.org/doku.php?id=load_application_running_in_bf561_core_b.

corebld.c: 
           Coreb loader

example/:

test.c: 
           A simple C program to be loaded to coreb. It changes the value in "0xFEB1FFFC".
           It is build using bfin-elf-gcc, with default link script in toolchain.
test_cpp:
           A simple C++ program to be loaded to coreb. It changes the value in "0xFEB1FFFC".
           Default bfin-elf-gcc linker script puts everything in L1. A simple C++ program is too large to be loaded into L1.
           So we used a customized linker script.
coreb_stub.S: 
           Used to link with test_cpp.o. Jump to BF561 coreb initialization code (or the entry point "__start").
           It should be placed to 0xFF600000, where coreB loads the first instruction when started.
coreb.lds: 
           Customized link script for test.cpp.

test_module/dulecore_test.c: Kernel module used together with "coreb_get_testarg.S"
. It writes "0xFEB1FFFC" with value "0x1". When exit, it read from "0xFEB1FFFC" and display.

To test:

1. Configure kernel to include "corebld" and boot uClinux on BF561 board.
2. "insmod dulecore_test.ko"
3. "corebld test_c"
4. "rmmod dulecore_test.ko" - you should see that "coreb_get_testarg" change
value in "0xFEB1FFFC" to "0x2" (or you can "cat /proc/coreb_testarg" to see the current value).
5. Reset the board - note that core A cannot reset core B. You will have to 
reset the two cores if you want to run the test again.

To test the C++ program, repeat above steps, while on step 3, do:
3. "corebld test_cpp"
4. "cat /proc/coreb_testarg" got "12".
