corebld - A simple ELF loader for BF561 core B

Files:

corebld.c: Coreb loader
coreb.lds: Linker script to create coreb ELF image.
coreb.S: Simple test code to be loaded on core B. It sets up coreb then do idle.
coreb_get_testarg.S: It sets up core B, then write "0x2" to address "0xFEB00000"
test_module/dulecore_test.c: Kernel module used together with "coreb_get_testarg.S"
. It writes "0xFEB00000" with value "0x1". When exit, it read from "0xFEB00000" and display.

To test:

1. Configure kernel to include "corebld" and boot uClinux on BF561 board.
2. "insmod dulecore_test.ko"
3. "coreld coreb_get_testarg"
4. "rmmod dulecore_test.ko" - you should see that "coreb_get_testarg" change
value in "0xFEB00000" to "0x2".
5. Reset the board - note that core A cannot reset core B. You will have to 
reset the two cores if you want to run the test again.
