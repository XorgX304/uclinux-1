CONFIG_USER_BUSYBOX_FEATURE_SHADOWPASSWDS
	  Build support for shadow password in /etc/shadow.  This file is only
	  readable by root and thus the encrypted passwords are no longer
	  publicly readable.

CONFIG_USER_BUSYBOX_USE_BB_SHADOW
	    If you leave this disabled, busybox will use the system's shadow
	    password handling functions.  And if you are using the GNU C library
	    (glibc), you will then need to install the /etc/nsswitch.conf
	    configuration file and the required /lib/libnss_* libraries in
	    order for the shadow password functions to work.  This generally
	    makes your embedded system quite a bit larger.

	    Enabling this option will cause busybox to directly access the
	    system's /etc/shadow file when handling shadow passwords.  This
	    makes your system smaller and I will get fewer emails asking about
	    how glibc NSS works).  When this option is enabled, you will not be
	    able to use PAM to access shadow passwords from remote LDAP
	    password servers and whatnot.

CONFIG_USER_BUSYBOX_USE_BB_PWD_GRP
	    If you leave this disabled, busybox will use the system's password
	    and group functions.  And if you are using the GNU C library
	    (glibc), you will then need to install the /etc/nsswitch.conf
	    configuration file and the required /lib/libnss_* libraries in
	    order for the password and group functions to work.  This generally
	    makes your embedded system quite a bit larger.

	    Enabling this option will cause busybox to directly access the
	    system's /etc/password, /etc/group files (and your system will be
	    smaller, and I will get fewer emails asking about how glibc NSS
	    works).  When this option is enabled, you will not be able to use
	    PAM to access remote LDAP password servers and whatnot.  And if you
	    want hostname resolution to work with glibc, you still need the
	    /lib/libnss_* libraries.

	    If you enable this option, it will add about 1.5k to busybox.

CONFIG_USER_BUSYBOX_ADDGROUP
	  Utility for creating a new group account.

CONFIG_USER_BUSYBOX_DELGROUP
	  Utility for deleting a group account.

CONFIG_USER_BUSYBOX_ADDUSER
	  Utility for creating a new user account.

CONFIG_USER_BUSYBOX_DELUSER
	  Utility for deleting a user account.

CONFIG_USER_BUSYBOX_GETTY
	  getty lets you log in on a tty, it is normally invoked by init.

CONFIG_USER_BUSYBOX_FEATURE_UTMP
	  The file /var/run/utmp is used to track who is currently logged in.

CONFIG_USER_BUSYBOX_FEATURE_WTMP
	  The file /var/run/wtmp is used to track when user's have logged into
	  and logged out of the system.

CONFIG_USER_BUSYBOX_LOGIN
	  login is used when signing onto a system.

	  Note that Busybox binary must be setuid root for this applet to
	  work properly.

CONFIG_USER_BUSYBOX_LOGIN_SCRIPTS
	  Enable this if you want login to execute $LOGIN_PRE_SUID_SCRIPT
	  just prior to switching from root to logged-in user.

CONFIG_USER_BUSYBOX_FEATURE_SECURETTY
	  The file  /etc/securetty  is used by (some versions of) login(1).
	  The file contains the device names of tty lines (one per line,
	  without leading /dev/) on which root is allowed to login.

CONFIG_USER_BUSYBOX_PASSWD
	  passwd changes passwords for user and group accounts.  A normal user
	  may only change the password for his/her own account, the super user
	  may change the password for any account.  The administrator of a group
	  may change the password for the group.

	  Note that Busybox binary must be setuid root for this applet to
	  work properly.

CONFIG_USER_BUSYBOX_FEATURE_PASSWD_WEAK_CHECK
	  With this option passwd will refuse new passwords which are "weak".

CONFIG_USER_BUSYBOX_SU
	  su is used to become another user during a login session.
	  Invoked without a username, su defaults to becoming the super user.

	  Note that Busybox binary must be setuid root for this applet to
	  work properly.

CONFIG_USER_BUSYBOX_SULOGIN
	  sulogin is invoked when the system goes into single user
	  mode (this is done through an entry in inittab).

CONFIG_USER_BUSYBOX_VLOCK
	  Build the "vlock" applet which allows you to lock (virtual) terminals.

	  Note that Busybox binary must be setuid root for this applet to
	  work properly.
