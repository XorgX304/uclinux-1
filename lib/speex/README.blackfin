Speex has been ported to the Blackfin DSP, for the STAMP development board.

This port has been tested on the STAMP development board and requires the 
toolchain available at http://blackfin.uclinux.org/

1/ In order to cross-compile for uClinux from the Speex tar-ball:

  ./configure --enable-blackfin-asm --enable-fixed-point --host=bfin-uclinux
  cd libspeex
  make

The --enable-blackfin-asm option is not required, but it speeds up Speex by
approximately a factor of two.

2/ In order to cross-compile for uClinux from the Speex SVN:

  svn co http://svn.xiph.org/trunk/speex
  cd speex
  ./autogen.sh
  ./configure --enable-blackfin-asm --enable-fixed-point --host=bfin-uclinux
  cd libspeex
  make
