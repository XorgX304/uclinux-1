README for libbfdsp: port of Analog Devices' Visual DSP++ DSP library to Linux

=== What is libbfdsp ===

The source code is taken from VDSP4.0. This library implements DSP functions.
After built, libbfdsp.a put to romfs/lib/, and headers are installed to 
/include/bfdsp/.

=== Directory ===

src/		Cource code of library, including .c, .asm, .S files
include/	Headers
test/		Test cases. Currently the test cases covers only a few functions.

=== Build ===

After setting up PATH to bfin-uclinux toolchain, run "make" at the top 
directory.  After building successfully, the library is copied as libbfdsp.a.

To build the tests, go the test/ directory and run "make" there.

=== Document ===

Please refer to Visual DSP++ help document for detailed definition of the 
funtions available.

=== Samples ===

Please refer to the test/ directory. Also please add "__ADSPBLACKFIN__" macro 
as a compile option.  It demos cfft, fir, vectors, cycle_count, etc.

=== Dependency ===

Use the Blackfin toolchain 2006R1 version or newer to build user applications.

=== Notes ===

1) Math library

The mathematics functions included in math.h (please refer to VDSP document), 
overlaps with stardand C math library.  Most of the functions are implemented 
in C, except for sqrt().  It is sometimes confusing to use. Before it is made 
clear there is optimization for Blackfin, standard math library in uClibc is 
suggested to use.

So only the math functions which is not in starndard C library are exported, 
including alogf(), alog10f(), rsqrt(), cot(), they are defined in math_bf.h. 

Since the library itself uses math function in uClibc math library, please add
"-lm" to your LDFLAGS when linking the library with your application.  Please
refer to the test sample.
