CONFIG_BLACKFIN_USE_FLAT
  Build all libraries and applicaions to produce flat binaries.
  FLAT binaries tend to be smaller. Their load time tend to be shorter.
  This option must match the choice made for the C library; when configuring
  uClibc, select the 'bfin' target.

CONFIG_FMT_USE_SHARED_FLAT
  Build all libraries and applicaions with -mid-shared-library.
  This option must match the choice made for the C library; when configuring
  uClibc, select the 'bfin' target.

CONFIG_FMT_USE_FDPIC_ELF
  Build all libraries and applicaions with -mfdpic to produce ELF binaries
  rather than the default flat binaries.  ELF binaries tend to be larger,
  but have more capabilities, such as support for dlopen.
  This option must match the choice made for the C library; when configuring
  uClibc, select either the 'bfin' target for flat binaries, or 'bfinfdpic'
  for ELF.

CONFIG_INSTALL_ELF_SHARED_LIBS
  If you wish to use some ELF binaries on a system with mostly flat binaries,
  enable this option to get the shared libraries from the toolchain
  distribution installed in the romfs.

CONFIG_INSTALL_FLAT_SHARED_LIBS
  If the majority of binaries in your system uses either static flat or ELF
  binaries, but there are some applications built against shared flat
  libraries, enable this option to get the shared flat libraries from the
  toolchain distribution installed in the romfs.

CONFIG_BLACKFIN_CHECK_STACKFLOW
  Build all libraries and applicaions with -fstack-limit-symbol=_stack_start.

CONFIG_USER_INETUTILS_RSH

CONFIG_USER_INETUTILS_RSHD
