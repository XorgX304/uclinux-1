This SMP patch was made for 2008R1. Limitations in current work are listed below.
1. Only support the cache policy: WriteThrough.
2. Disabled Memory Optimizations, we moved these functions to SDRAM.
3. Kernel module and applications can't be load into L1 memory, neither alloc data from L1 memory.
4. Not have L2 memory management function, but you can define variables that located in L2.
5. Applications that built with -mstack-check-l1, or calling uClibc's thread manage API may fail. Toolchain guys will work on it.
6. Both the Cores have the same interrupt settings, ie, both the core will response to the peripheral interrupt. Because each vector have a spin lock, except the tick interrupt, so only one Core will do the act things. 
7. Use GPTIMER0 instead of the CoreTimer, as the tick timer.
8. Not support power management.
