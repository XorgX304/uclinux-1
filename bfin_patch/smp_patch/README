This SMP patch was made for Trunk (kernel 2.6.26.2). Limitations in current work are listed below.
1. Only support the cache policy: WriteThrough.
2. Disabled Memory Optimizations, we moved these functions to SDRAM.
3. Kernel module and applications can't be load into L1 memory, neither alloc data from L1 memory.
4. Applications that built with -mstack-check-l1, or calling uClibc's thread manage API may fail. Toolchain guys will work on it.
5. Both the Cores have the same interrupt settings, ie, both the core will response to the peripheral interrupt. Because each vector has a spin lock, only one Core can do the act things. Note, tick interrupt will run on both Cores. 
6. Use GPTIMER0 instead of the CoreTimer, as the tick timer.
7. Not support power management.
