This folder only contains kgdboe patch for KGDB, which hasn't be merged
into kernel 2.6.26 in current blackfin/uClinux source tree. If you only
want to debug kernel with UART, you don't need this patch. If you hope
work with ethernet, you should apply this patch before configure and
build kernel with KGDB enabled. After we update kernel to 2.6.28 and later,
all files in this folder can be dropped.

You can find a simple guide on how to configure kgdb at:
http://docs.blackfin.uclinux.org/doku.php?id=linux-kernel:kgdb.
