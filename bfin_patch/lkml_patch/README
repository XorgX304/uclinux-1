README

Since 2.6.22-rcN, kernel will include Blackfin architecture code. But the kernel code from
kernel.org can not be compiled and booted on Blackfin because binfmt_flat and binfmt_elf_fdpic
need some dirty hack as well as the uclinux mtd maps code.

These 2 patches is for binfmt and uclinux mtd maps hack.

If you want test the mainline Blackfin code, please apply these patches for your further development.

When kernel mainline accept these patches, they will be dropped at that time.
